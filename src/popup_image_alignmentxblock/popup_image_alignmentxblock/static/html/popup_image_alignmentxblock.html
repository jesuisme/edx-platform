                                                        feels, he should go to the emergency department for evaluation.

                                            <p>IPUs can vary in design and implementation, and the field is young and
                                                evolving. However, the delivery of high-value care inherently implies
                                                certain characteristics. First and foremost, the IPU is
                                                patient-centered. The patient is always at the center of care delivery
                                                and of outcome measurement and treatment decisions. For all patients,
                                                outcomes and costs must be measured so that value can be provided. All
                                                care is iterative and value-based; when aspects of care delivery change
                                                because the patient’s needs change, they do so in real time and in
                                                direct response to those needs. To ensure this, the IPU must establish
                                                clear processes of communication and integrate enabling technology. The
                                                structure of the IPU allows for the collection of data across patient
                                                populations, honing understanding of this population’s care needs and
                                                further enriching the value provided by the IPU. </p>

                                                    multidisciplinary team, and there is a high prevalence worldwide.

                                                        told that the clinical pharmacist on the team can call them back
                                                        later today and give them advice about how to change his
                                                        regimen. Nick can then be seen within a few days by the nurse
                                                        practitioner and the dietician at the clinic. They will check in
                                                        on his progress and to discuss potential changes to his diet
                                                        that could help with blood sugar control – or if he prefers, he
                                                        can attend one of the group education sessions held at the

                                            <p>IPUs can vary in design and implementation, and the field is young and
                                                evolving. However, the delivery of high-value care inherently implies
                                                certain characteristics. First and foremost, the IPU is
                                                patient-centered. The patient is always at the center of care delivery
                                                and of outcome measurement and treatment decisions. For all patients,
                                                outcomes and costs must be measured so that value can be provided. All
                                                care is iterative and value-based; when aspects of care delivery change
                                                because the patient’s needs change, they do so in real time and in
                                                direct response to those needs. To ensure this, the IPU must establish
                                                clear processes of communication and integrate enabling technology. The
                                                structure of the IPU allows for the collection of data across patient
                                                populations, honing understanding of this population’s care needs and
                                                further enriching the value provided by the IPU. </p>

                                      <f><p>IPUs can vary in design and implementation, and the field is young and evolving. However, the delivery of high-value care inherently implies certain characteristics. First and foremost, the IPU is patient-centered. The patient is always at the center of care delivery and of outcome measurement and treatment decisions. For all patients, outcomes and costs must be measured so that value can be provided. All care is iterative and value-based; when aspects of care delivery change because the patient’s needs change, they do so in real time and in direct response to those needs. To ensure this, the IPU must establish clear processes of communication and integrate enabling technology. The structure of the IPU allows for the collection of data across patient populations, honing understanding of this population’s care needs and further enriching the value provided by the IPU. </p></f>
